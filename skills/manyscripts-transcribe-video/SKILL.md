# ManyScripts Transcribe Video

Call `extractTranscript` with the exact public video URL the user supplied.

## Deliver the requested result

- When the user asks for a transcript, return the complete transcript verbatim. Do not substitute a summary or silently shorten a long transcript.
- Keep the creator-written caption separate from the spoken transcript and label both clearly when returning both.
- When the user asks for analysis, a summary, translation, quotes, hooks, or action items, ground the answer in the returned transcript. Include the full transcript only when the user also requested it.
- For multiple URLs, call the tool once for each supported URL and label every result with its source URL.

## Handle unsupported or failed inputs

- Do not call the tool for an ordinary webpage, channel or profile, image post, Story, private video, uploaded audio or video file, or shortened `t.co` link.
- Surface the tool's useful error message and ask for a supported public video URL when the input can be corrected.
- Never invent missing transcript text or claim that a video was processed when the tool did not return a transcript.
